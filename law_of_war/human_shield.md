# Human shield 

"Utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations" is a breach of laws and customs of war, and is *war crime* 

See Article 8(2)(b)(xxiii) of the 1998 ICC Statute, Article 28 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV, Articles 12(4) and 51(7)  of the Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977

And this is exactly what Hamas and its supporters, including Antonio Guterres, are doing: trying to stop legitimate military action of Israel and protect Hamas and it's power in the Gaza strip referring to the presence of civilians in the city being a legitimate military target, as legitimate as Berlin in 1945.

What was required in 1945 was not a humanitarian ceasefire to protect the Nazis, but a complete and unconditional surrender of the Third Reich. Gaza must surrender, hand over hostages and transfer power over Gaza to Israel. Antonio Guterres must leave office. His connections with terrorist organizations and states, including financial, should be investigated.
