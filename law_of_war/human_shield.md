# Human shield 

"Utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations" is a breach of laws and customs of war, and is *war crime* 

See Article 8(2)(b)(xxiii) of the 1998 ICC Statute, Article 28 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV, Articles 12(4) and 51(7)  of the Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977

And this is exactly what Hamas and its supporters, including Antonio Guterres, are doing: trying to stop legitimate military action of Israel and protect Hamas and it's power in the Gaza strip referring to the presence of civilians in the city being a legitimate military target, as legitimate as Berlin in 1945.
